### **How to Prompt Cursor AI**

When you start working, don't paste the whole thing at once. Feed it Phase by Phase. For example:

**Prompt 1 (Setup):**

> "I am building an Angular mobile-first homeschooling app. Let's start with the Math module. Please implement **Phase 1** from the following plan. Create the Interfaces and a Service using Angular Signals to manage the state. Use the mock data provided in the description."

**Prompt 2 (Logic):**

> "Now let's do **Phase 2**. I need the `ExerciseEngineService`. Please write the Weighted Random Selection algorithm. It should favor cards with higher weights. Also, write the `submitAnswer` logic that adjusts weights based on speed (threshold 3000ms) and accuracy."
